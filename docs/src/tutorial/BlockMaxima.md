# Block Maxima Model

The stationary [`BlockMaxima`](@ref) model is illustrated using the annual maximum sea-levels recorded at Port Pirie in South Australia from 1923 to 1987, studied by Coles (2001) in Chapter 3. The annual maxima are assumed **independent and identically distributed**.

```@setup portpirie
using Extremes, DataFrames, Distributions, Gadfly
```

The *Extremes.jl* package supports maximum likelihood inference, Bayesian inference and inference based on the probability weigthed moments. For the GEV parameter estimation, the following functions can be used:
- [`gevfitpwm`](@ref): estimation with the probability weighted moments;
- [`gevfit`](@ref): maximum likelihood estimation;
- [`gevfitbayes`](@ref): Bayesian estimation.


!!! note "Log-scale paremeter"

    These functions return the estimate of the log-scale parameter $\phi = \log \sigma$.


## Load the data

Loading the annual maximum sea-levels at Port Pirie:
```@example portpirie
data = Extremes.dataset("portpirie")
first(data,5)
```

The annual maxima can be shown as a function of the year using the Gadfly package:
```@example portpirie
set_default_plot_size(12cm, 8cm)
plot(data, x=:Year, y=:SeaLevel, Geom.line)
```

## Maximum likelihood inference


### GEV parameter estimation

The GEV parameter estimation with maximum likelihood is performed with the [`gevfit`](@ref) function:

```@repl portpirie
fm = gevfit(data, :SeaLevel)
```

!!! note
    In this example, the [`gevfit`](@ref) function is called using the data *DataFrame* structure as the first argument. The function can also be called using the vector of maxima as the first argument, *e.g.* `gevfit(data[:,:SeaLevel])`.

The vector of the parameter estimates ``\hat\mathbf{\theta} = (μ̂,\, ϕ̂,\, ξ̂)^\top`` is contained in the field `θ̂` of the structure `fm:<fittedEVA`.

The approximate covariance matrix of the parameter estimates can be obtained with the  [`parametervar`](@ref) function:
```@repl portpirie
parametervar(fm)
```

Confidence intervals for the parameters are obtained with the [`cint`](@ref) function:
```@repl portpirie
cint(fm)
```

For instance, the shape parameter 95% confidence interval is as follows:
```@repl portpirie
cint(fm)[3]
```

### Diagnostic plots

Several diagnostic plots for assessing the accuracy of the GEV model fitted to the Port Pirie data are can be shown with the [`diagnosticplots`](@ref) function:

```@example portpirie
set_default_plot_size(21cm ,16cm)
diagnosticplots(fm)
```

The diagnostic plots consist in the probability plot (upper left panel), the quantile plot (upper right panel), the density plot (lower left panel) and the return level plot (lower right panel). These plots can be displayed separately using respectively the [`probplot`](@ref), [`qqplot`](@ref), [`histplot`](@ref) and [`returnlevelplot`](@ref) functions.


### Return level estimation

*T*-year return level estimate can be obtained using the [`returnlevel`](@ref) function. For example, the 100-year return level for the Port Pirie block maxima model is computed as follows:
```@repl portpirie
r = returnlevel(fm, 100)
```

The return level can be accessed as follows:
```@repl portpirie
r.value
```

The corresponding confidence interval can be computed with the [`cint`](@ref) function:
```@repl portpirie
c = cint(r)
```

!!! note "Type-stable function"

    In this example of a stationary model, the function returns a unit dimension vector for the return level and a vector containing only one vector for the confidence interval. The reason is that the function always returns the same type in the stationary and non-stationary case. The function is therefore [type-stable](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/manual/performance-tips/index.html#Write-%22type-stable%22-functions-1) allowing better performance of code execution.  

To get the scalar return level in the stationary case, the following command can be used:
```@repl portpirie
r.value[]
```

To get the scalar confidence interval in the stationary case, the following command can be used:
```@repl portpirie
c[]
```


## Bayesian Inference

Most functions described in the previous sections also work in the Bayesian context.

### GEV parameter estimation

The Bayesian GEV parameter estimation is performed with the [`gevfitbayes`](@ref) function:

```@repl portpirie
fm = gevfitbayes(data, :SeaLevel)
```

!!! note "Prior"

    Currently, only the improper uniform prior is implemented, *i.e.*
    \\[ f_{(μ,ϕ,ξ)}(μ,ϕ,ξ) ∝ 1. \\]
    It yields to a proper posterior as long as the sample size is larger than 3 ([Northrop and Attalides, 2016](https://www.jstor.org/stable/24721296?seq=1)).

!!! note "Sampling scheme"

    Currently, the No-U-Turn Sampler extension ([Hoffman and Gelman, 2014](http://jmlr.org/papers/v15/hoffman14a.html)) to Hamiltonian Monte Carlo ([Neel, 2011, Chapter 5](https://www.mcmchandbook.net/)) is implemented for simulating an autocorrelated sample from the posterior distribution.

The generated sample from the posterior distribution is contained in the field `sim` of the fitted structure. It is an object of type *MCMCChains* from the [*MCMCChains.jl*](https://github.com/TuringLang/MCMCChains.jl) package.

Credible intervals for the parameters are obtained with the [`cint`](@ref) function:
```@repl portpirie
cint(fm)
```


## Inference based on the probability weighted moments

Most functions described in the previous sections also work for the model fitted with the probability weighted moments.

### GEV parameter estimation

The parameter estimation based on the probability weighted moments is performed with the [`gevfitpwm`](@ref) function:

```@repl portpirie
fm = gevfitpwm(data, :SeaLevel)
```

The approximate covariance matrix of the parameter estimates using a bootstrap procedure can be obtained with the [`parametervar`](@ref) function:
```@repl portpirie
parametervar(fm)
```

Confidence intervals on the parameter estimates using a bootstrap procedure can be obtained with the [`cint`](@ref) function:
```@repl portpirie
cint(fm)
```
