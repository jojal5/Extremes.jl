# Contributing

Contributions are welcomed. Here's the workflow for development of new features, refactoring and bugfix.

```
master             # Stable branch, always ready to be tagged
dev                # Development branch. New features, refactoring, bug and hotfix
                   # are integrated into dev before going into master.
feature/           # New feature needs a `feature` prefix
   <feature-name>     
refactor/          # Refactoring are tagged with a `refactor` prefix
   <refactor-name>
bug/               # Prefix for bugs found during development
   <bug-fix>       
hotfix/            # Prefix for hotfix (bugs for deployed versions)
   <hot-fix>    
```
